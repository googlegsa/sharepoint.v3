Note:
-----
If you have already installed Google Services for SharePoint or Google Search Box for SharePoint earlier using the old installer (i.e. GSS.msi or GSBI.msi or Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 1.0.0), please uninstall them before trying the Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 1.0.1 installer.

2. The Installer does not validate the 'Artifact Consumer' URL on "Google SAML Bridge for Windows - Configuration Wizard".
3. Cancelling Installer does not intiate rollback of the installed components. You need to run installer again in 'remove' mode to clean up the installed components.
