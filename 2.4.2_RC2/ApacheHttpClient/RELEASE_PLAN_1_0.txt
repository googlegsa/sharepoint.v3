Release Plan for HTTP Client 1.0
--------------------------------

Administrivia:

This document describes a plan for the 1.0 release of the
Jakarta-Commons HTTP Client component (for the remainder
of this document, simply "HTTP Client").  Per the
Jakarta/ASF guidelines
(http://jakarta.apache.org/site/decisions.html), this
document doesn't mean anything until accepted by the
relevant committer community via a lazy majority vote
(hereafter, simply "lazy majority").  Once accepted, it may
be replaced by an alternative plan, again subject to lazy
majority approval.

Non-binding votes (votes cast by those outside the relevant
committer community) are welcome, but only binding votes
are significant for decision making purposes.

Objective:

The objective of 1.0 release of HTTP Client is to provide a
stable, relatively bug free release compatible with Jakarta
Slide project and its clients (for the remainder of this
document, simply "Slide").

Any known bugs that can be corrected with minimal
disruption to Slide should be addressed.  Any remaining
bugs or deviations from the relevant specifications and
protocols should be noted as "known issues" in the final
release notes.

Timeline: (let's say GMT in case of doubt)

* Wednesday, 5 September 2001

  On or before 5 September 2001, all bugs to be addressed
  and all features to be added or removed will be
  identified.  The decision as to whether a bug fix or
  feature is deemed "in-scope" for a 1.0 release is to be
  determined by a lazy majority vote.

  A tentative list includes:

  (Note that these are all bugs/issues with the main branch
  in Jakarta-Commons.  The version in the Slide tree may or
  may not have the same set of issues, but we should at
  least confirm.)

   + Remove logging changes (rolling back to the stdout
     based debugging, or removing logging altogether)
   + Address the "multiple header bug": When two response
     headers with the same name are sent, one of them is
     ignored. (HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 say we should treat
     "a: one" and "a: two" and "a: one, two".)
   + Address the following HTTP redirect bugs:
     + Query string changes are silently ignored during
       redirect.
     + Host/port changes are silently ignored during
       redirect.
     + Protocol changes are silently ignored during
       redirect
   + Address the following HTTPS related bugs
    (alternatively, remove support for HTTPS altogether):
     + Redirects fail for all HTTPS requests
     + When connecting via a proxy, HTTPS parameter is
       silently ignored (i.e., we speak HTTP to the proxy
       and from the proxy to the destination server)
   + Address the following cookie related bugs
     (alternatively, remove support for cookies
     altogether):
     + isToBeDiscarded() returns wrong value (false for
       true/true for false)
     + Path is ignored when accepting cookies
     + Secure cookies are accepted over insecure
       connections
     + Secure cookies are transmitted over insecure
       connections
     + When only name/value is supplied, path defaults to
       "/".  When domain or other parameter is supplied,
       path defaults to null.
     + Secure parameter being inapproriately sent in
       "cookie" header.
     + Expires attribute doesn't work for some date formats
       accepted by commons browsers and sent by common
       servers.
     + "Deleting" cookies doesn't fully work--cookies
        remain in State (but are not transmitted)
     + When cookies exist but no cookies match the given
       request, "Cookie: $Version=1" is submitted, rather
       than no Cookie header at all.
     + When not specified, cookie path should default to
       (directory containing the) request path, not "/"
   + NameValuePair.equals method throws NullPointerException
     when name or value is null

  (Assuming this plan is accepted, I'll follow up with a
  ballot along these lines.)

* Wednesday, 12 September 2001

  (Hopefully) the in-scope changes will be addressed by 12
  September 2001, at which time a formal release vote will
  be called, subject to lazy majority approval.  A formal
  release vote may be called before 12 September, if
  appropriate.
