Release 1.0.0, 7 Dec, 2009
===========================

INTRODUCTION
------------
This is an early access release for wide evaluation and usage. Your feedback is important to us. Keep in mind that we are continuing to work on Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 1.0.0 (64-bit) and things may change in the future.

Pre-requisites
---------------
* SharePoint 2007 (WSS 3.0, MOSS 2007) server.
* Windows Server 2003 Enterprise server.
* Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0.
* IIS 6.0.

Note:
-----
If you have already installed Google Services for SharePoint or Google Search Box for SharePoint earlier using the old installer (i.e. GSS.msi or GSBI.msi), please uninstall them before trying the Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 1.0.0 installer.

Features
---------
1. Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 1.0.0 (64-bit) installer bundles following components:
	a) Google Search Box for SharePoint: It represents Google Search Box for SharePoint. When selected, the Google Search Box for SharePoint is enabled on all SharePoint web applications on a machine, which share the same search control.
	b) Google Services for SharePoint: The Google Services for SharePoint are custom web services used by the Google Search Appliance Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2007
	c) GSA Resource Kit for SharePoint: It represents the following utilities:
			-Google Search Box for SharePoint Test Utility : It is used to verify the Google Search Box for SharePoint parameters, cookies and headers. 
			-GSA Security SPI Simulator: It is used to test Google SAML Bridge for Windows without involving the complexity of the search appliance. Once you know that the SAML Bridge works, you can reconfigure it to work with the search appliance.
			-Google SAML Bridge for Windows: It enables Google Search Box for SharePoint to perform search on NTLM contents.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 92: Validation for the 12 hive folder should be added on 'Select installation folder panel' or this field should be non-editable. In the new installer the text field is made non-editable. User can select folder through browse button for each of the components he wants to install.
Issue 93: There is no way to navigate back and correct the path, if user has mistakenly provided incorrect path for the installation folder, after clicking "Next". The Installer detects the SharePoint installation and installs all the selected components at desired location. This prevents user from making such mistakes. User is also allowed to change the default location in case they have a non-standard SharePoint deployment.
Issue 95: Installation/un-installation summary panel text should be changed. Earlier user used to get "Installation Complete" even for un-installation. This has beed fixed in the new installer.
Issue 107 - Google Search Box installer fails to detect local SharePoint web applications if its URL has a different host name.

* Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS 2007)

3. Cancelling Installer does not intiate rollback of the installed components. You need to run installer again in 'remove' mode to clean up the installed components.
