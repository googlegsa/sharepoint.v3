Release 3.2.8, June 16, 2014
============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality and performance
without adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
encouraged to upgrade.

This connector replaces functionality previously provided by the
SharePoint connector. This connector can be used automatically in
conjunction with the SharePoint connector as a drop-in replacement for
the previous functionality, or used separately with other connectors
or content sources.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.6
------------------------	
15386188 - Slow UPDATEs during traversal by AD Groups connector on MS SQL 
           server database causes slow SELECTs during group resolution due to 
           table locking.

15329561 - AD Groups connector deleted all entities in DB after LDAP query 
           timeout.

12570906 - AD Groups connector should log time taken to resolve all groups 
           for a user.

10508533 - highestcommittedusn column should be of type BIGINT instead of INT.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 3.0.0 through 3.2.4 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 3.2.6 and above. Versions lower than 3.2.6 of the Connector
Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

Java SE 5.0 is no longer supported. Java 6 or later is required. To
use an external database, a JDBC 4.0 compliant driver is required.

For optimal performance, if you are upgrading from a previous 3.0.x
version, you need to ensure that all required indexes are available.
You can either create them manually, or if feasible, Google recommends
dropping the database tables and resetting the traversal for your connector
instances after the upgrade. When using the default H2 database, you can
simply delete the connector_manager.h2.db file under
Tomcat/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/connector_manager.db
while Tomcat is stopped.

Note that when using the AD groups connector with the SharePoint
connector, resetting the traversal with an AD groups connector instance
embedded in a SharePoint connector instance will result in reindexing
your SharePoint content as well as Active Directory. Deleting the H2
database will also clear the cache of SharePoint groups, which is used
for group lookup with ACLs. Restoring the cache requires reindexing your
SharePoint content.


Release 3.2.6, April 25, 2014
=============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality and performance
without adding any new functionality. Users of previous releases are
encouraged to upgrade.

This connector replaces functionality previously provided by the
SharePoint connector. This connector can be used automatically in
conjunction with the SharePoint connector as a drop-in replacement for
the previous functionality, or used separately with other connectors
or content sources.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.4
------------------------	
10344956 - AD Groups connectors configured with an external database
           (Oracle or SQL Server) failed to restore lost connections
           to the database. Using an external database now requires a
           JDBC driver that supports the isValid method of
           java.sql.Connection, part of the JDBC 4.0 specification in
           Java 6.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 3.0.0 through 3.2.4 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 3.2.6 and above. Versions lower than 3.2.6 of the Connector
Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

encouraged to upgrade.

This connector replaces functionality previously provided by the
SharePoint connector. This connector can be used automatically in
conjunction with the SharePoint connector as a drop-in replacement for
the previous functionality, or used separately with other connectors
or content sources.

Issues Fixed Since 3.2.2
------------------------	
12843710 - Subsequent full traversals for the AD groups connector take a long
           time as the connector updates all entities in database even if
           entities are not modified in Active Directory.

11991908 - Optimization to resolve groups recursively for group lookup.

11571282 - Version 3.2.2 does not work when configured to use Oracle database
           as data store for group membership.

11449993, 10836391 - Optimize SQL updates and queries for handling tombstones.

8595321 - The AD groups connector does not support incremental traversals when
          running as a separate connector instance.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 3.0.0 through 3.2.2 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 3.0.0 and above. Versions lower than 3.0.0 of the Connector
Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.
