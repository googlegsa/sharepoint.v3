Release 1.3.2, April 10, 2009
=============================

INTRODUCTION 
=============
This is a maintenance release that improves quality, reliability, and performance without adding any new functionality. All users of previous 1.3.x releases should upgrade to this release. See the product website for a complete description.

Version compatibility
=============================

This connector release is compatible with Connector Manager v1.3.2 and above. Earlier versions of the Connector Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.
It is suggested that customers using SharePoint Connector versions 1.0.0 through 1.3.0 and considering upgrading 1.3.2  should do a clean install of Connector Manager v1.3.2 and then install Google SharePoint Connector v1.3.2. This product is designed to function with Microsoft SharePoint 2003, SharePoint 2007, WSS 2.0, WSS 3.0


ISSUES FIXED IN THIS RELEASE:
=============================
- Issue 63: Connector does not support the various strict Windows security templates that come up with NTLM Version 2.
- Issue 71: The connector configuration form should be XHTML compliant. Because of certain JavaScript dependecies introduced in this fix, this connector version will not support connector manager versions prior to 1.3.2.
