Release 2.6.8 , 7 Dec 2010
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This is a patch release for wide evaluation and usage.  Your feedback is important to us.
Keep in mind that we are continuing to work on Google Enterprise Connector for Microsoft SharePoint and things may change in the future.

Summary of Changes / New Features
---------------------------------
This patch contains fix for the following issues

[Issue 3260602] SP connector batch authZ should handle site collection URLs correctly for authZ grouping of URLs to avoid intermittent indeterminate results

The bug was in the comparator used for grouping documents (to be authorized) according to their parent site collections.
Each site collection is treated as a bucket wherein the documents belonging to that site collection are stored and set for authorization.
The bug, in certain use cases, causes document URLs being put in wrong bucket which leads to authZ failures.


[Issue 3260584] Allow alias mapping to be applied over record URL along with displayURL

Added following boolean properties in connectorInstance.xml to give users option to choose whether record URL and/or display URl be re-written using
alias mapping rules specified on connector configuration page:
<!-- Applicable for both Metadata-and-URL and content feed. If set to true, the document display URL (shown to the search users) will be re-written using alias mapping rule specified on connector configuration page. -->
<!-- <property name="reWriteDisplayUrlUsingAliasMappingRules"><value>true</value></property> -->

<!-- Applicable only for Metadata-and-URL feed. If set to true, the document record URL will also be re-written using alias mapping rule specified on connector configuration page. -->
<!-- <property name="reWriteRecordUrlUsingAliasMappingRules"><value>false</value></property> -->

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version works with Connector Manager Version 2.4.0 and above.
It is recommended to upgrade to the latest Connector Manager version which is 2.6.0
Versions lower than 2.4.0 of the Connector Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

Connectors with version 2.4.0 and above can be safely upgraded using the steps given below.

Steps to manually deploy the patch release
------------------------------------------
1. Stop the SharePoint Connector Service.
2. Open the directory $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.
3. Replace the file "connector-sharepoint.jar" with the new jar downloaded from the Code Site.
4. Replace $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/connectors/sharepoint-connector/$CONNECTOR_INSTANCE$/connectorInstance.xml with
the new connectorInstance.xml provided with the build. If you had updated some properties in your older connectorInstance.xml, you'll have to
update them explicitly in the new connectorInstance.xml.
5. Start the SharePoint Connector Service.

Note: You also need to update the bulk authorization web service. Next section gives the complete manual upgrade instruction for all services.
Also, to have an optimal authorization performance, it is recommended to install/update the site discovery service as well.

Steps to manually deploy the Google services for SharePoint
-----------------------------------------------------------
Google services for SharePoint which are installed as web service files at the following location of your SharePoint server:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\ISAPI

To update bulk authorization web service, update the following three files:
GSBulkAuthorization.asmx
GSBulkAuthorizationdisco.aspx
GSBulkAuthorizationwsdl.aspx

To update site discovery web service, update the following three files:
GSSiteDiscovery.asmx
GSSiteDiscoverydisco.aspx
GSSiteDiscoverywsdl.aspx

To update ACL web service, update the following three files:
GssAcl.asmx
GssAcldisco.aspx
GssAclwsdl.aspx

Note: This patch has been tested against blank form templates and sample form templates provided by Microsoft Office InfoPath 2007.

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
1) Issue 59: The following exception occurs intermittently on some machines where the local ports are not released properly after being used.
java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind
Workaround: Stop the connector and restart it after some time to avoid this issue. Also increase the # of available ports as described here:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;196271

2) Issue 70: Connector configuration is saved for invalid domain name when the authentication scheme for SharePoint site is NTLM and
the credentials used are of a local machine user.

4) In this release, following features are not supported on SharePoint versions prior to SP2007
- Fix for issue#53 (Connector should support SharePoint farm )
- Bulk Authorization by connector
- ACL

5) SharePoint groups are not resolved in the current ACL support. The implication of this is that all the users who have granted access on documents not directly but through a SharePoint group will not be authorized at search time.
Connector do send the SharePoint groups in the ACLs but these groups are of no use unless they are resolved at serve time. This is planned feature for the next release.

6) The "Kerberos KDC Hostname" field on connector configuration page is not localized

7) Issue 139: Upgrade HTTPClient library and AXis to newer versions
-- When SharePoint server is slow in serving content, Connector Manager gets java.lang.IOException when pulling content of a
document. One observation is that this exception occurs whenever the
"java.net.SocketException: No buffer space available (maximum connections reached?): JVM_Bind"
occurs as reported in Issue 59

Stacktrace seen in logs:
java.io.IOException: Attempted read on closed stream.
at org.apache.commons.httpclient.AutoCloseInputStream.isReadAllowed(AutoCloseInputStream.java:183)
at org.apache.commons.httpclient.AutoCloseInputStream.read(AutoCloseInputStream.java:107)

Impact: Document content cannot be fetched and hence not indexed whenever this problem is encountered
Possible workaround:
-- Ensure that the SharePoint server is fast enough for serving content
-- Also please see the workaround mentioned in Issue 59

8) Issue 140: jcifs classes are not initialized when connector is run on Linux 64-bit environment
-- HttpClient-Modified library makes use of Jcifs for supporting NTLM V2. On Suse Linux 64-bit environment it has been observed that Jcifs classes like
Type1Message are not initialized properly and hence connector configuration does not gets saved.

Release 2.6.6 , 18 Nov, 2010
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This is a patch release for wide evaluation and usage.  Your feedback is important to us.

Summary of Changes / New Features
---------------------------------
This patch contains fix for the following issues

Issue 174: Handle folder rename/restore cases more judiciously
Fixed a bug wherein connector was getting stuck in one particular case of folder rename/restore

Issue 113: Connector fails to detect changes if there is a huge gap in the activity on the SharePoint Server, goes into an infinite loop
With the current fix, the connector will initiate a full traversal of the site/list Whose change token (persisted in connector state file)
has got expired

This build also have some optimization in the authorization is done at serve time. Documents are now grouped according to their parent site
collection before sending then to the authorization web service installed on SharePoint server. This grouping helps in reusing certain
SharePoint objects that were earlier created and destroyed for every individual documents.

Release 2.6.4 , 16 Sept, 2010
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This is a patch release for wide evaluation and usage.  Your feedback is important to us.
Keep in mind that we are continuing to work on Google Enterprise Connector for Microsoft SharePoint and things may change in the future.

Summary of Changes / New Features
---------------------------------
This patch contains fix for the following issues

Issue 50: Connector does not crawl a SharePoint entity if it contains an invalid XML character in its metadata.
Connector make use of a web service message handler which intercepts the WS response to check if it contains invalid XML characters. If found,
replaces the same with a value that is configured in org.apache.axis.client.client-config.wsdd. In addition, additional patterns can also be provided
in this file that the handler should filter out from WS response.

Handler's filtering feature is not used for every WS call. Rather, connector decides to make use of it only when a WS call fails
abruptly due to parsing error. In such cases, connector makes a second attempt to the WS call requesting handler to do its job.

As stated earlier, all configurations related to handler is stored in client.client-config.wsdd file. Hence, to add/remove filter patterns
You would need to modify this file. Since this file is inside the connector jar, it cannot be modified directly. Following are the steps
you need to execute for the same:
1. Extract client-config.wsdd from connector-sharepoint.jar
2. Do the required changes
3. Put the updated client-config.wsdd under $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/classes
4. Restart the connector

issue 166: The Alias mapping is not working as expected for List items and Documents
This was a bug in 2.6.2 that was causing alias mapping to fail for list items and documents. This has been resolved in the current 2.6.4 build.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version works with Connector Manager Version 2.4.0 and above.
It is recommended to upgrade to the latest Connector Manager version which is 2.6.0

Release 2.6.0 , 22 June, 2010
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release with some enhancements and bug fixes. Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.
Users of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section below for instructions on how to use existing data with this new release.

Summary of Changes / New Features
---------------------------------
- Added support for ACL. Connector now sends ACL as document metadata along with each document that it feeds to the GSA. It also keep track of any security changes happening on SharePoint which might affect the ACL of entities, the entities are re-crawled and re-fed to GSA in such cases.
Google Services for SharePoint (GSS) are now shipped with one more service specific to ACL. You need to deploy this web service on SharePoint to get the ACl support.
The support for ACL is turned off by default. Following are the steps to turn this feature on:
1. Go to the connector instance directory of the connector for which you want to turn on ACL.
The connector instance directory can be found under $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/connectors/sharepoint-connector/CONNECTOR
Replace CONNECTOR with the actual name of your connector
2. Open connectorInstance.xml
3. Scroll down to the end until you find the ACL Related flags
4. Uncomment the following
<!--
<property name="pushAcls"><value>false</value></property>
<property name="stripDomainFromAces"><value>true</value></property>
-->
5. Change the value of the pushAcls property (the first flag) to true.
6. Save the updated connectorInstance.xml
7. Restart the connector

After restarting, connector will send document's ACLs as part of the metadata which will be parsed by the GSA and uploaded as Policy ACLs under Serving section of the GSA.
Connector would not make any attempt to send ACLs for the documents that it had crawled before the restart.

Note: For ACL, the minimum required permission is either a "Full Read" at web application level or, the user should be the site collection administrator. The user credential that you use to configure the connector must have either of these two permissions if you are willing to use ACL based authorization of search results.
Note: The current ACL support does not have the handling of SharePoint groups. Please refer to the 6th point under Known Issues/Limitations section.

- Issue 148: SharePoint connector should support SharePoint 2010
  All the entities which are supported on SP 2007 are now also supported on SP 2010

- Issue 79: Support for include/exclude a site/page in the search results
Connector, during the crawl checks if a site/list search visibility is turned on. If not, it pauses the crawling of that particular site/list. If it is a new site/list, no crawling is done for this.
Note: For this feature, You need to install the custom GSSiteDiscovery web service on every SharePoint front end server where the sites to be crawled are hosted. This web service comes as part of Google Services for SharePoint. The steps for manual installation is same as of the ACL web service with the files being changed. In this case the files to be copied in the ISAPI directory are:
GSSiteDiscovery.asmx
GSSiteDiscoverydisco.aspx
GSSiteDiscoverywsdl.aspx

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version works with Connector Manager Version 2.4.0 and above. It is recommended to upgrade to Connector Manager 2.4.4
Versions lower than 2.4.0 of the Connector Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

Note: In case of a SharePoint farm environment, the web service has to be deployed on all front-end servers which are hosting sites that you want the connector to crawl.

Platform Support
------------------
The connector can be installed and run on both 32-bit & 64-bit Windows and Linux environments.

Certified Against

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
1) Issue 50: Connector does not crawl a SharePoint entity if it contains an invalid XML character in its metadata.
-- With 2.0 release, the connector used to re-crawl all documents from the SharePoint list which has documents with
invalid XML character in its metadata. From 2.4 release, the connector will not crawl any new documents from the
list unless the document is removed from the SharePoint list OR the metadata is corrected
Workaround:
Remove the problematic document from the SharePoint list OR the remove the invalid characters from metadata

2) Issue 59: The following exception occurs intermittently on some machines where the local ports are not released properly after being used.
java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind
Workaround: Stop the connector and restart it after some time to avoid this issue. Also increase the # of available ports as described here:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;196271

3) Issue 70: Connector configuration is saved for invalid domain name when the authentication scheme for SharePoint site is NTLM and
the credentials used are of a local machine user.

4) Issue 113: Connector fails to detect changes if there is a huge gap in the activity on the SharePoint Server, goes into an infinite loop
-- This is the case when the SharePoint's Change log is reset OR the change tokens maintained by connector are no longer maintained
by SharePoint's Change log. In such cases the connector logs as WARNING message. The connector will have to be reset and crawl
and index all content once more
Workaround: Re-crawl all content by resetting the connector

5) In this release, following features are not supported on SharePoint versions prior to SP2007
- Fix for issue#53 (Connector should support SharePoint farm )
- Bulk Authorization by connector
- ACL

6) SharePoint groups are not resolved in the current ACL support. The implication of this is that all the users who have granted access on documents not directly but through a SharePoint group will not be authorized at search time.
Connector do send the SharePoint groups in the ACLs but these groups are of no use unless they are resolved at serve time. This is planned feature for the next release.

7) The "Kerberos KDC Hostname" field on connector configuration page is not localized

8) Issue 139: Upgrade HTTPCLient library and AXis to newer versions
-- When SharePoint server is slow in serving content, Connector Manager gets java.lang.IOException when pulling content of a
document. One observation is that this exception occurs whenever the
"java.net.SocketException: No buffer space available (maximum connections reached?): JVM_Bind"
occurs as reported in Issue 59

Stacktrace seen in logs:
java.io.IOException: Attempted read on closed stream.
at org.apache.commons.httpclient.AutoCloseInputStream.isReadAllowed(AutoCloseInputStream.java:183)
at org.apache.commons.httpclient.AutoCloseInputStream.read(AutoCloseInputStream.java:107)

Impact: Document content cannot be fetched and hence not indexed whenever this problem is encountered
Possible workaround:
-- Ensure that the SharePoint server is fast enough for serving content
-- Also please see the workaround mentioned in Issue 59

9) Issue 140: jcifs classes are not initialized when connector is run on Linux 64-bit environment
-- HttpClient-Modified library makes use of Jcifs for supporting NTLM V2. On Suse Linux 64-bit environment it has been observed that Jcifs classes like
Type1Message are not initialized properly and hence connector configuration does not gets saved.

Release 2.4.0 Build5, 03 December, 2009
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This is an upgrade release with some enhancements and bug fixes. Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.
Users of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section below for instructions on how to use existing data with this new release.

Summary of Changes
------------------
New features:
---------------
1) Support for Kerberos Authentication at crawl time
2) Support for filtering of documents based on mimetype

Issues fixed from last release:
---------------------------------
Issue 74 - Support traversal by Kerberos authentication.
This is a new feature. This will mean that customers can now crawl SharePoint content which is protected by Kerberos.
Earlier, NTLM was being used at crawl time. This will be useful for customers which require Kerberos to be used always.
Issue 85 - The discovery of site collection should be initiated in the first crawl cycle even though no content is crawled.
In case there were no sites/lists under the top level site mentioned as crawl URL, the connector did not initiate the discovery of other sites.
This implied that the connector never initiated a traversal. This is resolved with this fix
Issue 87 - Connector should canonicalize the URLs for child entities before applying include/exclude patterns.
This is required to exclude all ASPX pages from indexing. Earlier this was not possible as the list URLs (which end with ASPX extension)
would get excluded and hence no content was being discovered and fed to GSA. Users can configure the connector exclude all aspx pages
Issue 90 - The time at which connector completes a crawl cycle should be logged in state file.
This is an enhancement to the information logged in state file. It helps to precisely know when did the traversal cycle complete,
when was the site/list queried last time for any updates
Issue 101 - Sending metadata to GSA when doc size > 30M.
GSA rejects any content > 30M. In content feed mode the connector has now added this check so that only metadata and URL are sent without content
This avoids the task of feeding content which will be rejected by GSA eventually.
It also adds support for filtering documents based on mimetype
Issue 102 - Liststate entry is deleted from the connector state without checking if the list is deleted.
The entry for a list was deleted without checking if the SharePoint server was temporarily unavailable or the list was actually deleted. This has been fixed
so that the list entry is removed only if it has been deleted.
Issue 106 - Connector should not remove/delete documents from its queue unless checkPoint() is called.
The documents from crawl queue were deleted before checkpoint is called. Customers will not see any visible impact as this change
is more to be in line with SPI specification unless any exception is encountered when documents are being sent to GSA by Connector Manager
Issue 110 - Connector is not editable when password has ampersand (&) character. Connector configuration page throws XML error.
From 1.3.2 version onwards the connector form is XHTML complaint. As part of this, every feild needs o be XHTML complaint else
it will result in a XML parsing exception. The value of password field has now been XML encoded to be XHTML complaint
Issue 116 - Return batchHint or little more docs from start/resumeTraversal and not 2* batchHint.
Connector Manager now supports accepting more # documents than batchHint per batch traversal. Hence the connector tries to discover
a little more than batchHint rather than 2*batchHint # of documents as done earlier. This will not have any impact on how fast the documents are being
indexed. However, you will find that the connector will now index documents from list1, then list2 and so on. Earlier you would find that
the connector would discover documents from list1, list2 simultaneously as long as the cap of (2*batchHint) was not reached.
Issue 118 - All the extra IDs (URLs in case of attachments) which are used during the construction of delete feeds are updated before checkpoint
This was required as part of fix for Issue 106 else, delete feeds for few attachments was not being sent earlier.
Issue 120 - Use file level custom logging instead of event-log based logging
The logging of custom web services (GSS) was done to the event viewer. Now it is logged in the main connector logs under Tomcat/logs folder
Issue 123 - Initial changes on the SharePoint are not tracked if the connector is restarted before the first traversal completes
If the connector was stopped before the first traversal was completed, then few docs from that folder/list were skipped.
This has been fixed now.
Issue 124 - ExtraIDs are un-necessarily updated in-memory in case of Metadata and URL feed mode.
This does not have any visible change for the customers. The extraId is used in content feed only and not not be updated for metadata and URL feed mode


Version Compatibility
---------------------
This version works with Connector Manager version 2.4.0 and above.
Versions lower than 2.4.0 of the Connector Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

Platform Support
------------------
The connector can be installed and run on both 32-bit & 64-bit Windows and Linux environments

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
1) Issue 50: Connector does not crawl a SharePoint entity if it contains an invalid XML character in its metadata.
-- With 2.0 release, the connector used to re-crawl all documents from the SharePoint list which has documents with
invalid XML character in its metadata. With 2.4 release the connector will not crawl any new documents from the
list unless the document is removed from the SharePoint list OR the metadata is corrected
Workaround:

2) Issue 59: The following exception occurs intermittently on some machines where the local ports are not released properly after being used.
java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind
Workaround: Stop the connector and restart it after some time to avoid this issue.

3) Issue 70: Connector configuration is saved for invalid domain name when the authentication scheme for SharePoint site is NTLM and
the credentials used are of a local machine user.


4) Issue 108: Connector is unable to traverse the repository upon restart if the state file is very large
-- If the size of the state file is >= 100 MB, then connector fails to load the state file due to insufficient memory. An
OutOfMemory Error is thrown while parsing the state XML.
Workaround:
Increase the memory allocated to tomcat so that enough memory is available for parsing the state XML.
To increase the memory allocated to the connector follow the steps given below:
This change will allocate 2GB (i.e. 2048MB) of memory.
LINUX
======
Open the file: <Connector Installation Path>/<Connector Name>/Tomcat/bin/catalina.sh
Search for: JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms256m -Xmx1024m
Change it to: JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms256m -Xmx2048m

WINDOWS
========
Open the file: <Connector Installation Path>\<Connector Name>\Tomcat\bin\service.bat
Search for (must be towards the end of the file) : --JvmMs 256 --JvmMx 1024
Change it to: --JvmMs 256 --JvmMx 2048

Note: To be able to allocate memory successfully, the system must have at least twice
as much physical memory.

5) Issue 113: Connector fails to detect changes if there is a huge gap in the activity on the SharePoint Server, goes into an infinite loop
-- This is the case when the SharePoint's Change log is reset OR the change tokens maintained by connector are no longer maintained
by SharePoint's Change log. In such cases the connector logs as WARNING message. The connector will have to be reset and crawl
and index all content once more
Workaround: Re-crawl all content by resetting the conenctor

6) In this release, following features are supported only on SharePoint 2007
- Fix for issue#53 (Connector should support SharePoint farm )
- Bulk Authorization by connector

7) The "Kerberos KDC Hostname" field on connector configuration page is not localized
