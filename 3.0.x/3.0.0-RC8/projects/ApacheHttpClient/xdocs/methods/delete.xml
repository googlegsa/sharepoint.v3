    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>The delete method requests that the origin server delete the resource
      identified by the request URL.  This method <i>may</i> be overridden by
      human intervention (or other means) on the origin server.  The client
      cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the
      status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action has
      been completed successfully.  However, the server <i>should not</i>
      indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to
      delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location.</p>

      <p>A successful response <i>should</i> be 200 (OK) if the response
      includes a response body describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the
      action has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has
      been enacted but the response does not include a response body.</p>

      <p>If the request passes through a cache and the URL identifies one or
      more currently cached entities, those entries <i>should</i> be treated as
      stale.  Responses to this method are not cacheable.</p>

    <section name="Typical Usage">
      <p>The delete method is used by supplying a URL to delete the resource at
      and reading the response from the server.</p>

      <source><![CDATA[
        DeleteMethod delete = new DeleteMethod("http://jakarata.apache.org");
        // execute the method and handle any error responses.
        ...
        // Ensure that if there is a response body it is read, then release the
        // connection.
        ...
        delete.releaseConnection();

    <section name="Common Problems">
      <p>The DELETE method is not widely supported on public servres due to
      security concerns and generally FTP is used to delete files on the
      webserver.  Before executing a DELETE method, it may be worth checking
      that DELETE is supported using the <a href="options.html">OPTIONS</a>
      method.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="RFC Section">
      <p>The delete method is defined in section 9.7 of <a
      href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a>.</p>
