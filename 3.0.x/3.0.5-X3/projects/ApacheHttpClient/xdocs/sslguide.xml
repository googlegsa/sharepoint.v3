       HttpClient provides full support for HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or IETF Transport Layer
       Security (TLS) protocols by leveraging the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/index.html">
       Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)</a>. JSSE has been integrated into the Java 2 platform as of 
       version 1.4 and works with HttpClient out of the box. On older Java 2 versions JSSE 
       needs to be manually installed and configured. Installation instructions can be found
       <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/doc/guide/API_users_guide.html#Installation">here</a>
     </p>

    <section name="Standard SSL in HttpClient">
      <p>
        Once you have JSSE correctly installed, secure HTTP communication over SSL should be as simple 
        as plain HTTP communication.

  } finally {
    httpget.releaseConnection();

      <p>
        HTTPS communication via an authenticating proxy server is also no different from plain HTTP 
        communication. All the low-level details of establishing a tunneled SSL connection are handled
        by HttpClient:

  httpclient.getHostConfiguration().setProxy("myproxyhost", 8080);
  httpclient.getState().setProxyCredentials("my-proxy-realm", " myproxyhost",
  new UsernamePasswordCredentials("my-proxy-username", "my-proxy-password"));
  GetMethod httpget = new GetMethod("https://www.verisign.com/");
  try { 
    httpclient.executeMethod(httpget);
    System.out.println(httpget.getStatusLine());
  } finally {
    httpget.releaseConnection();
  }]]></source>

    <section name="Customizing SSL in HttpClient">
      
      <p>
      The default behaviour of HttpClient is suitable for most uses, however
      there are some aspects which you may want to configure.  The most common
      requirements for customizing SSL are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ability to accept self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.  This
      is highlighted by an <code>SSLException</code> with the message
      <i>Unrecognized SSL handshake</i> (or similar) being thrown when a
      connection attempt is made.</li>

      <li>You want to use a third party SSL library instead of Sun's default
      implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
     Implementation of a custom protocol involves the following steps:
    </p>

    <ol>

      <li>
       <p>
       Provide a custom socket factory that implements 
       <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/protocol/SecureProtocolSocketFactory.html">
       org.apache.commons.httpclient.protocol.SecureProtocolSocketFactory</a> interface. The socket 
       factory is responsible for opening a socket to the target server 
       using either the standard or a third party SSL library and
       performing any required initialization such as performing the
       connection handshake.  Generally the initialization is performed
       automatically when the socket is created.
       </p>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p>
       Instantiate an object of type <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/protocol/Protocol.html">
       org.apache.commons.httpclient.protocol.Protocol</a>.  The new instance
       would be created with a valid URI protocol scheme (https in this
       case), the custom socket factory (discussed above) and a default port
       number (typically 443 for https).  For example:
       </p>

      <source><![CDATA[
Protocol myhttps = new Protocol("https", new MySSLSocketFactory(), 443);
      ]]></source>

      <p>
      The new instance of protocol can then be set as the protocol handler
      for a HostConfiguration.  For example to configure the default host and
      protocol handler for a HttpClient instance use:
      </p>

      <source><![CDATA[
HttpClient httpclient = new HttpClient();
httpclient.getHostConfiguration().setHost("www.whatever.com", 443, myhttps);
GetMethod httpget = new GetMethod("/");
try {
  httpclient.executeMethod(httpget);
  System.out.println(httpget.getStatusLine());
} finally {
  httpget.releaseConnection();
}]]></source>

      </li>

      <li>
       <p>
        Finally, you can register your custom protocol as the default handler
        for a specific protocol designator (eg: https) by calling the
        Protocol.registerProtocol method.  You can specify your own protocol
        designator (such as 'myhttps') if you need to use your custom
        protocol as well as the default SSL protocol implementation.
       </p>

      <source><![CDATA[
Protocol.registerProtocol("myhttps", 
new Protocol("https", new MySSLSocketFactory(), 9443));
      ]]></source>

       <p>
        Once registered the protocol be used as a 'virtual' scheme inside target URIs.
       </p>

      <source><![CDATA[
HttpClient httpclient = new HttpClient();
GetMethod httpget = new GetMethod("myhttps://www.whatever.com/");
try {
  httpclient.executeMethod(httpget);
  System.out.println(httpget.getStatusLine());
} finally {
  httpget.releaseConnection();
}]]></source>


      <p>
       If you want this protocol to represent the default SSL protocol implementation, simply register
       it under 'https' designator, which will make the protocol object take place of the existing one
      </p>

      <source><![CDATA[
Protocol.registerProtocol("https", 
new Protocol("https", new MySSLSocketFactory(), 443));
HttpClient httpclient = new HttpClient();
GetMethod httpget = new GetMethod("https://www.whatever.com/");
try {
  httpclient.executeMethod(httpget);
  System.out.println(httpget.getStatusLine());
} finally {
  httpget.releaseConnection();
}]]></source>

     There are several custom socket factories available in our contribution
     package. They can be a good start for those who seek to tailor the
     behavior of the HTTPS protocol to the specific needs of their
     application:

    <section name="Known limitations and problems">

      <ol>

        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>Persistent SSL connections do not work on Sun's JVMs below 1.4</strong>
         </p>
     
         <p>
         Due to what appears to be a bug in Sun's older (below 1.4) implementation of 
         Java Virtual Machines or JSSE there's no reliable way of telling if an SSL connection 
         is 'stale' or not. For example, the HTTP 1.1 specification permits HTTP servers in 
         'keep-alive' mode to drop the connection to the client after a given period inactivity 
         without having to notify the client, effectively rendering such connection unusable or 
         'stale'. For the HTTP agent written in Java there's no reliable way to test 
         if a connection is 'stale' other than attempting to perform a read on it.
         However, a read 
         operation on an idle SSL connection on Sun JVM older than 1.4 returns 'end of stream' 
         instead of an expected read timeout. That effectively makes the connection appear 'stale' 
         to HttpClient, which leaves it with no other way but to drop the connection and to 
         open a new one, thus defeating HTTP 1.1 keep-alive mechanism and resulting in significant 
         performance degradation (SSL authentication is a highly time consuming operation). The problem appears to have been fixed in Sun's 
         Java 1.4 SSL implementation.  Sockets which are not using HTTPS are
         unaffected on any JVM.
         </p>

         <p>
         <strong>Workaround:</strong> Disable stale connection check if upgrade to Java 1.4 or above is 
          not an option. Please note that HttpClient will no longer be able to detect invalid connections
          and some requests may fail due to transport errors. For details on how transport errors can be 
          recovered from please refer to the <a href="exception-handling.html#Transport%20exceptions">
          Exception Handling Guide</a>. If persistent SSL connections support and transport reliability 
          is an issue for your application we strongly advise you to upgrade to Java 1.4.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          <strong>Authetication schemes that rely on persistent connection state do not work on Sun's JVMs 
          below 1.4 if SSL is used</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          This problem is directly related to the problem described above. Certain authentication schemes or 
          certain implementations of standard authentication schemes are connection based, that is, the user 
          authentication is performed once when the connection is being established, rather than every time
          a request is being processed. Microsoft NTLM scheme and Digest scheme as implemented in Microsoft 
          Proxy and IIS servers are known to fall into this category. If connections cannot be kept alive
          the user authorization is lost along with the persistent connection state
         </p>
         <p>
         <strong>Workaround:</strong> Disable stale connection check or upgrade to Java 1.4 or above.
         </p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <p>
         <strong>JSSE prior to Java 1.4 incorrectly reports socket timeout.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to Java 1.4, in Sun's JSSE implementation, a read operation that has timed out incorrect
         reports end of stream condition instead of throwing java.io.InterruptedIOException as expected.
         HttpClient responds to this exception by assuming that the connection was dropped and throws a 
         NoHttpResponseException. It should instead report "java.io.InterruptedIOException: Read timed 
         out". If you encounter NoHttpResponseException when working with an older version of JDK and 
         JSSE, it can be caused by the timeout waiting for data and not by a problem with the connection.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>Work-around:</strong> One possible solution is to increase the timeout value as the server is
         taking too long to start sending the response. Alternatively you may choose to upgrade to Java 1.4 or 
         above which does not exhibit this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         The problem has been discovered and reported by Daniel C. Amadei.
        </p>

        <li>
        <p>
         <strong>HttpClient does not work with IBM JSSE shipped with IBM Websphere Application Platform</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Several releases of the IBM JSSE exhibit a bug that cause HttpClient to fail while detecting the size
         of the socket send buffer (java.net.Socket.getSendBufferSize method throws java.net.SocketException:
         "Socket closed" exception).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure that you have all the latest Websphere fix packs applied and IBMJSSE
         is at least version 1.0.3. HttpClient users have reported that IBM Websphere Application Server versions 
         4.0.6, 5.0.2.2, 5.1.0 and above do not exhibit this problem.
        </p>

    <section name="Troubleshooting">

       <p>
        JSSE is prone to configuration problems, especially on older JVMs,
        which it is not an integral part of.  As such, if you do encounter
        problems with SSL and HttpClient it is important to check that JSSE is
        correctly installed.
       </p>

       <p>
        The application below can be used as an ultimate test that can reliably
        tell if SSL configured properly, as it relies on a plain socket in
        order to communicate with the target server. If an exception is thrown
        when executing this code, SSL is not correctly installed and configured.
        Please refer to Sun's official resources for support or additional
        details on JSSE configuration.
