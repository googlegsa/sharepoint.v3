    <!-- Resolving entities from the BUILTIN container can grant unintentional privileges to users.

         For example:
         If the BUILTIN\administrators group contains user "userA" in the SharePoint frontend and
         BUILTIN\administrators group contains user "userB" in the Domain controller, then if you
         include the group BUILTIN\administrators in a SharePoint ACL, "userB" will be given access
         via the GSA to this document because the AdGroups connector resolves the BUILTIN group
         against domain controller and not the content server.

         Only enable this setting if you are not manually restricting access to BUILTIN
         groups on individual File System or Sharepoint servers and are using the 
         Active Directory defaults. -->
    <!-- By default, the AdGroups connector does not resolve BUILTIN groups. To Enable
         the resolution of BUILTIN set the property returnBuiltin to YES. -->
    <!-- <property name="returnBuiltin" value="YES"/> -->
