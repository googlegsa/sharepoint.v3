INTRODUCTION

Note:
-----
If you have already installed Google Services for SharePoint or Google Search Box for SharePoint earlier using the old installer (i.e. GSS.msi or GSBI.msi or Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 1.x.x), please uninstall them before trying the Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 2.6.0 installer.

			-Google Search Box for SharePoint Test Utility : It is used to verify the Google Search Box for SharePoint parameters, cookies and headers. 
			-GSA Security SPI Simulator: It is used to test Google SAML Bridge for Windows without involving the complexity of the search appliance. Once you know that the SAML Bridge works, you can reconfigure it to work with the search appliance.

3. Cancelling Installer does not intiate rollback of the installed components. You need to run installer again in 'remove' mode to clean up the installed components.
