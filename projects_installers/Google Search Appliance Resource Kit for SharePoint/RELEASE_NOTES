Release 3.2.0, 10 Oct, 2013
===========================

INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a major release with new features.  Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.  
Users of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section below.

Features
--------
Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 3.2.0 (32-bit) installer bundles the following 
components:
   
   * Connector Services for SharePoint
   * Search Box for SharePoint
   * SAML Bridge for Windows
   
   Connector Services for SharePoint (formerly Google Services for SharePoint): Custom web services
     used by the Google Search Appliance Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2007.
   
   Search Box for SharePoint:  The Google Search Box for SharePoint replaces the native SharePoint 
     site search with search provided by the Google Search Appliance, while retaining the look-and-
     feel of the native SharePoint search facility.
   
   SAML Bridge for Windows:  Authenticates the user when a search is performed.  It consists of the 
     following components:
     - Google Search Box for SharePoint Test Utility : Verifies the Search Box for SharePoint 
       parameters, cookies and headers. 
     - GSA Security SPI Simulator: It is used to test SAML Bridge for Windows without involving the
       complexity of the search appliance. Once you know that SAML Bridge for Windows works, you 
       can reconfigure it to work with the search appliance.
     - SAML Bridge for Windows: It enables Search Box for SharePoint to perform search on NTLM 
       contents.

Platform Support
----------------
* Windows Server 2003 or 2008, Standard Edition or higher.

Pre-requisites
--------------
* Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.
* IIS 6.0/IIS 7.0.

* Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS 2007) 
* Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (WSS 3.0)

Note:
-----
* If you have already installed Content Services for SharePoint or Search Box for SharePoint 
  earlier using the old installer (i.e. GSS.msi or GSBS.msi or Google Search Appliance Resource Kit
  for SharePoint 1.x or Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 2.x or Google Search 
  Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 3.0), please uninstall them before trying the Google Search
  Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint 3.2.0 installer.
* Microsoft SharePoint is not required if you are installing only GSA Security SPI Simulator or 
  SAML Bridge for Windows.
* There are separate installers for 32-bit and 64-bit Operating System.
* The 64-bit installer is supported on machines with x64 platform.

-------------------------------
--Issue 4364197 Search Box for SharePoint should support SAML POST binding.

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
1. The Installer does not validate the port number for 'GSA Resource Kit for SharePoint'. User 
   needs to enter a valid non-conflicting port during installation. Assigned port number could be
   changed even after Installation directly through IIS Manager.
2. The Installer does not validate the 'Artifact Consumer' URL on "Google SAML Bridge for Windows
   - Configuration Wizard".
3. Cancelling Installer does not initiate rollback of the installed components. You need to run 
   installer again in 'remove' mode to clean up the installed components.
4. SharePoint web applications added after Search Box for SharePoint is installed will not 
   automatically use the Google search box.
