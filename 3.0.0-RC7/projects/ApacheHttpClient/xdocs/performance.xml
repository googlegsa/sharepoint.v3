       By default HttpClient is configured to provide maximum reliability and standards 
       compliance rather than raw performance. There are several configuration options and
       optimization techniques which can significantly improve the performance of HttpClient.
       This document outlines various techniques to achieve maximum HttpClient performance.

    <section name="Reuse the HttpClient instance">
      <p>
       Generally it is recommended to have a single instance of HttpClient per communication
       component or even per application. However, if the application makes use of HttpClient 
       only very infrequently, and keeping an idle instance of HttpClient in memory is not warranted,
       it is highly recommended to explicitly <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.html#shutdown()">
       shut down</a> the multithreaded connection manager prior to disposing
       the HttpClient instance. This will ensure proper closure of all HTTP connections in the
       connection pool. 
     </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Connection persistence">
      <p>
       HttpClient always does its best to reuse connections. Connection persistence is enabled 
       by default and requires no configuration. Under some situations this can lead to leaked
       connections and therefore lost resources. The easiest way to disable connection persistence
       is to provide or extend a connection manager that force-closes connections
       upon release in the <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/HttpConnectionManager.html#releaseConnection(org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpConnection)">
       releaseConnection</a> method.
     </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Concurrent execution of HTTP methods">
      <p>
      If the application logic allows for execution of multiple HTTP requests concurrently 
      (e.g. multiple requests against various sites, or multiple requests representing 
      different user identities), the use of a dedicated thread per HTTP session can result in a 
      significant performance gain. HttpClient is fully thread-safe when used with a thread-safe
      connection manager such as <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.html">
      MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager</a>. Please note that each respective thread of execution 
      must have a local instance of HttpMethod and can have a local instance of HttpState or/and
      HostConfiguration to represent a specific host configuration and conversational state. At the
      same time the HttpClient instance and connection manager should be shared among all threads 
      for maximum efficiency.
     </p>
      <p>
      For details on using multiple threads with HttpClient please refer to the <a href="threading.html">
      HttpClient Threading Guide</a>.  
     </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Request/Response entity streaming">
      <p>
      HttpClient is capable of efficient request/response body streaming. Large entities may be submitted 
      or received without being buffered in memory. This is especially critical if multiple HTTP 
      methods may be executed concurrently. While there are convenience methods to deal with entities such as
      strings or byte arrays, their use is discouraged. Unless used carefully they can easily lead to
      out of memory conditions, since they imply buffering of the complete entity in memory.
     </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Response streaming:</strong> It is recommended to consume the HTTP response body as a stream of
       bytes/characters using HttpMethod#getResponseBodyAsStream method. The use of HttpMethod#getResponseBody and 
       HttpMethod#getResponseBodyAsString are strongly discouraged.
      <source><![CDATA[
  HttpClient httpclient = new HttpClient();
  GetMethod httpget = new GetMethod("http://www.myhost.com/");
  try {
    httpclient.executeMethod(httpget);
    Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(
            httpget.getResponseBodyAsStream(), httpget.getResponseCharSet()); 
    // consume the response entity
  } finally {
    httpget.releaseConnection();
  }]]></source>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Request streaming:</strong> The main difficulty encountered when streaming request bodies is that
        some entity enclosing methods need to be retried due to an authentication failure or an I/O failure. 
        Obviously non-buffered entities cannot be reread and resubmitted. The recommended approach is to create a custom 
        <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/methods/RequestEntity.html">RequestEntity</a> capable of 
        reconstructing the underlying input stream.
      <source><![CDATA[
public class FileRequestEntity implements RequestEntity {

    private File file = null;
    
    public FileRequestEntity(File file) {
        super();
        this.file = file;
    }

    public boolean isRepeatable() {
        return true;
    }

    public String getContentType() {
        return "text/plain; charset=UTF-8";

        InputStream in = new FileInputStream(this.file);
        try {
            int l;
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
            while ((l = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                out.write(buffer, 0, l);
            }
        } finally {
            in.close();
        }
    }

    public long getContentLength() {
        return file.length();
    }
}

File myfile = new File("myfile.txt");
PostMethod httppost = new PostMethod("/stuff");
httppost.setRequestEntity(new FileRequestEntity(myfile));]]></source>

    <section name="Expect-continue handshake">
      <p>
      The purpose of the HTTP 100 (Continue) status is to allow a client sending a request entity to 
      determine if the target server is willing to accept the request (based on the 
      request headers) before the client sends the request entity. It is highly inefficient for the client
      to send the request entity if the server will reject the request without looking at the body. 
      Authentication failures are the most common reason for the request to be rejected based on the request
      headers alone. Therefore, use of the 'Expect-continue' handshake is especially recommended with 
      those target servers that require HTTP authentication. For proxied requests caution
      must be taken as older HTTP/1.0 proxies may be unable to correctly handle the 'Expect-continue' 
      handshake.
     </p>
     <p>
     See the <a href="preference-api.html">http.protocol.expect-continue</a> parameter documentation 
     for more information.
     </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Stale connection check">
      <p>
      HTTP specification permits both the client and the server to terminate a persistent (keep-alive) 
      connection at any time without notice to the counterpart, thus rendering the connection invalid
      or stale. By default HttpClient performs a check, just prior to executing a request, to determine if the 
      active connection is stale. The cost of this operation is about 15-30 ms, depending on the JRE used.
      Disabling stale connection check may result in slight performance improvement, especially for small
      payload responses, at the risk of getting an I/O error when executing a request over a connection 
      that has been closed at the server side.
     </p>
     <p>
     See the <a href="preference-api.html">http.connection.stalecheck</a> parameter documentation for more 
     information.

    <section name="Cookie processing">
      <p>
      If an application, such as web spider, does not need to maintain conversational state with the target
      server, a small performance gain can made by disabling cookie processing. For details 
      on cookie processing please to the <a href="cookies.html">HttpClient Cookies Guide</a>.
