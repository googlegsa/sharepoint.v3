Release 3.0.8, May 31, 2013
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

This connector replaces functionality previously provided by the
SharePoint connector. This connector can be used automatically in
conjunction with the SharePoint connector as a drop-in replacement for
the previous functionality, or used separately with other connectors
or content sources.

Summary of Changes
------------------
This release contains fixes for the following issues:

--Issue 8429292 AD Groups connector crashes if it encounters a group with a
                multiple of 1500 members.

--Issue 8300059 Performance improved for SharePoint group resolution query
                if an index is created for column members.memberid.

--Issue 7417736 Resolving BUILTIN groups from domain controller may provide
                unintentional access. Local BUILTIN groups such as Users
                and Administrators from the file share may be included in
                ACLs, but the groups are resolved against the domain
                controller's BUILTIN groups of the same name. There is now
                a configuration property to disable group lookup for these
                groups.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 may be
used with this version. This version works with Connector Manager
version 3.0.0 and above. Versions lower than 3.0.0 of the Connector
Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

For optimal performance, if you are upgrading from a previous 3.0.x
version, Google recommends dropping the database tables and resetting the
traversal for your connector instances after the upgrade. When using the
default H2 database, you can simply delete the connector_manager.h2.db
file under Tomcat/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/connector_manager.db
while Tomcat is stopped.
