Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for SharePoint Project!

The Google Search Appliance Connector for SharePoint enables the Google Search Appliance to search and serve documents and other content stored in Microsoft SharePoint.

The best way to deploy the connector is to use the installer from http://code.google.com/p/googlesearchapplianceconnectors/downloads/list.

You would use the zip download only if you'd like to do a manual install, installing on an unsupported platform, or customization.
