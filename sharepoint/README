Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for SharePoint

The Google Search Appliance Connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems. An
enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Google Search Appliance Connector for SharePoint enables the
appliance to traverse documents and attachments on SharePoint sites.
The connector supports SPS 2003 (SharePoint Portal Server), MOSS 2007
(Microsoft Office SharePoint Server), WSS 2.0, WSS 3.0 (Windows
SharePoint Services), SP 2010 (SharePoint Server 2010), and SharePoint
Foundation 2010. The Metadata blacklist and whitelist for the
documents has been externalized.

The Google Search Appliance Connector for Microsoft SharePoint
communicates with the SharePoint Server using the SharePoint Web services
and feed SharePoint content to the search appliance.
