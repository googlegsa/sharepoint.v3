STEPS TO DEPLOY THE PATCH RELEASE ON 2.0.0
===========================================
1. Stop the SharePoint Connector Service.
2. Extract the downloaded connector-sharepoint-2.0.2.zip at some location on your machine.
3. Open the directory $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.
4. Replace the file "connector-sharepoint.jar" with the new jar found in the extracted connector-sharepoint-2.0.2 folder.
   If you want to back-up the older jar file, please back-it up to a folder other than the Tomcat folder. Leaving a back-up in the same directory can create issues.
5. Start the SharePoint Connector Service.

Note: $CATALINA_HOME stands for the folder where the connector's Tomcat is deployed. It is usually :
C:\Program Files\GoogleConnectors\<%Installation name%>\Tomcat
