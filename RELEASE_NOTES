Release 1.1.1, 5 Dec, 2009
==========================

Introduction
-------------
This is an upgrade release with some enhancements and bug fixes. Users of previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.
Users of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section below for instructions on how to use existing data with this new release.

Summary of Changes
------------------
New features:
-------------
1. Google Search Box for SharePoint 1.1.1 supports search on NTLM contents. This is possible by	configuring SAML Bridge on GSA (http://code.google.com/apis/searchappliance/documentation/50/admin/wia.html#deployment) along with 'Google Search Appliance Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2003 and Microsoft SharePoint 2007' configured in content-feed mode.
2. Google Search Box for SharePoint 1.1.1 is bundled with "Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint" installer which also bundles other related components such as
		* Google Services for SharePoint : It includes SharePoint custom web services which are used by SharePoint connector for traversal, Authentication & Authorization.
		* GSA Resource Kit for SharePoint : It includes:
			-Google Search Box for SharePoint Test Utility : It is used to verify the Google Search Box parameters, cookies and headers.
			-GSA Security SPI Simulator: It is used to test "Google SAML Bridge for Windows" without involving the complexity of the GSA. Once you know that the SAML Bridge works, you can reconfigure it to work with the search appliance.
			-Google SAML Bridge for Windows: It enables "Google Search Box for SharePoint 1.1.1" to perform search on NTLM contents.
			
   For a farm setup, you need to install the Google Search Box on all the SharePoint 1.1.1 Installations (machines).

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
1. Fixed Issue 84 - Google Search Box should support NTLM authentication scheme on SharePoint. This is supported by configuring Google SAML Bridge for Windows on Google Search Appliance.
2. Fixed Issue 86 - Content encoding problems when searching from Google Search Box when kerberos is enabled on GSA. This is handled in the new Search Box code and user need not do any additional settings on the browser.
3. Fixed Issue 119 - Google Search Box for SharePoint gives "access denied" when search is fired from a normal user. Google Search Box for SharePoint allows you to perform search from even a non-site admin user.
