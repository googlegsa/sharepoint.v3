            <p>
                HttpClient project has taken a very important step toward becoming 
                a full-fledged Jakarta level project. From today, HttpClient is
                a separate project in Apache Bugzilla issue tracking system. It is no 
                longer a component of the Commons project. Please use the following
                details when filing bug reports for 2.0 and 3.0 branches of HttpClient:

               <p>
                Currently HttpClient project is debating whether we should continue using Bugzilla
                as an issue tracking system or migrate to JIRA. 
                <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a> is a newer, more flexible

            <p>
                We are pleased to announce the final alpha release of HttpClient 3.0.
                At this point HttpClient is fully feature-complete and is just a 
                few issue reports short of being code and documentation complete. 
                All of the important new features such as the new preferences 
                architecture and exception handling framework are completely documented. 
                We strongly encourage comment and criticism of the current API so we can
                have everything worked out by the first beta release. Following this 
                release the development effort will focus on stabilizing the 3.0 API 
                and adding more documentation. Depending on on how well this release is 
                received, as well as the quality and quantity of feedback, we are looking 
                at an API freeze in one to two months time.

    <section name="17 May 2004 - HttpClient 3.0 alpha1 released">
        <p>We are pleased to announce the first HttpClient 3.0 release.
         HttpClient 3.0 provides a wealth of features and enhancements
         that did not make it into the 2.0 release, while preserving API
         compatibility as much as possible. In a relatively few cases
         <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta/commons/proper/httpclient/trunk/API_CHANGES_3_0.txt?view=markup">API
         compatibility with HttpClient 2.0</a> could not maintained.
        </p>
        <p>   
         Noteworthy enhancements include:
         <ul>
          <li>New preference architecture</li>
          <li>Improved exception handling framework</li>
          <li>Granular non-standards configuration and tracking</li>
          <li>Improved authentication framework</li>
          <li>Plug-in mechanism for authentication modules</li>
          <li>Cookie specification plug-in mechanism</li>
          <li>Cross-site redirect support</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
         We see our fellow Apache developers as well as other open-source
         projects already reliant on HttpClient as the primary target
         audience for this release. This is the right time to evaluate
         HttpClient 3.0 and give us some feedback, critique or other thought on
         the new API.  Please feel free to file requests for additional features.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of the second ALPHA release is to incorporate the feedback, polish 
         the API, and update documentation. The next ALPHA release will target the
         wider audience beyond the Apache Jakarta and Apache WS communities.

      <p>Releasing a final version of HttpClient 2.0 by the end of Summer 2003, as 
       originally planned, was not possible. There were a significant number of minor 
       bugs reported against RC1. None of them were major, but verifying, fixing, and 
       testing simply took time more time than anticipated.  We are pleased to 
       announce the second release candidate of HttpClient 2.0 and hope to follow up 
       with a final release shortly.</p>
      <p>At the same time we have been busy working on our next release, currently 
       designated as 2.1. It it shaping up quite well. We already have a new preferences 
       architecture in place that will help us provide greater control over HttpClient 
       without polluting its API with too many options. We have also completely reworked 
       redirect/authentication/retry logic and can now support cross-host redirects, a 
       much complained about limitation of HttpClient 2.0.</p>

    <section name="25 January 2003 - HttpClient 2.0 Alpha 2 released">
      <p>After many months and a great resurgence of developers, the new build
        of <em>HttpClient</em> is finally here.  The new group of developers has done
        extensive refactoring to move the project along the new vision.
        The code base has reached a significant level of maturity and we
        expect that the beta builds will come quickly and that the 
        final release of 2.0 is not far away!</p>
