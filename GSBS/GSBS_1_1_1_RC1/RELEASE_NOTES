Summary of Changes
------------------

New features:
-------------
1. Google Search Box for SharePoint supports search on NTLM contents. This is possible by
	a) Configuring SAML Bridge on GSA (http://code.google.com/apis/searchappliance/documentation/50/admin/wia.html#deployment) or
	b) Configuring IWA (Integrated Windows Authentication)\Kerberos on GSA (http://code.google.com/apis/searchappliance/documentation/62/secure_search/secure_search_crwlsrv.html#kerberos_authentication)
	
along with 'Google Search Appliance Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2003 and Microsoft SharePoint 2007' configured in content-feed mode.

2. Google Search Box for SharePoint is bundled with "Google Search Appliance Resource Kit for SharePoint" installer which also bundles other related components such as
		* Google Services for SharePoint : It includes SharePoint custom web services which are used by SharePoint connector for traversal, Authentication & Authorization.
		* GSA Resource Kit for SharePoint : It includes:
			-Google Search Box for SharePoint Test Utility : It is used to verify the Google Search Box parameters, cookies and headers.
			-GSA Security SPI Simulator: It is used to test "Google SAML Bridge for Windows" without involving the complexity of the GSA. Once you know that the SAML Bridge works, you can reconfigure it to work with the search appliance.
			-Google SAML Bridge for Windows: It enables "Google Search Box for SharePoint" to perform search on NTLM contents.
			
   For a farm setup, you need to install the Google Search Box on all the SharePoint Installations (machines).
