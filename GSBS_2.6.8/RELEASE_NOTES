==========================

Summary of Changes
------------------

Issues fixed:
-------------
1) Issue 105 - Support site/list level search scope (context sensitive) with Google Search Box in SharePoint 

   o Earlier version of Google Search Box for SharePoint supported search at a global level. There was no mechanism to restrict the search results to a particular site/ list/ folder in SharePoint.
   o Hence, added support for context-sensitive search with Google Search Box for SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010
   o Scopes make it possible to narrow searches to particular locations/entities. Added a scopes dropdown alongwith Google Search Box for SharePoint. Scopes dropdown consists of the following scopes : Current Site, Current Site and all subsites, Current List, Current Folder and Current Folder and all subfolders.   
   o Used the technique of "directory restricted search" for getting the search results restricted to a particular scope selected by the user. Hence, added code to get the currently selected scope's URL. 
   o Modified the search request sent to the GSA to include the scope search parameter. Used the 'sitesearch' parameter which will hold the currently selected scope's URL value.
   o With this, the search results are restricted to the scope selected by the user.
   o Also added code which will persist the values of public search checkbox status, search query term and selected scope while navigating between search results using previous and next buttons.

2) Issue 156: Search Box to support public content in SharePoint

   o Earlier version of Google Search Box for SharePoint supported public and secure search, i.e. the search was intended to search for both, the public and secure content indexed by the GSA. There was no mechanism to return only public content matching the search query. 
   o The GSA Resource Kit for SharePoint 2.6.8 contains support for public search, by which the user can selectively query for public content only. 			
   
   
   For a farm setup, you need to install the Google Search Box on all the SharePoint 2.6.8 Installations (machines).
