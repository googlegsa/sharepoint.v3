 8.   The user needs to enable the session state for persisting the search query term and public search checkbox status. To enable session state for performing search with Google search box, the httpmodule for session state needs to be added.
      In case you have multiple SharePoint web applications, you need to enable the session state for all the web applications to perform search from sites
      of respective SharePoint web application. Following are the steps to enable session state for a given SharePoint web application.

      * In web.config file, go to "<httpModules>" section (For MOSS 2007only), and add the following module under it -
                 
        <add name="Session" type="System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule" />

       * (Perform this step only for SharePoint 2010) Go to "<modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true">" section and add the following module under it at the end, i.e. just before the closing tag for modules -

        <add name="session" type="System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule" preCondition="managedHandler" />               

 9.  To setup SharePoint like frontend:

       *  Open GSA Admin page->Serving->FrontEnd 
       *  Create a new frontend "SPS_frontend" 
       *  Copy the contents of file "SPS_frontend.xslt" 
       *  Save it 
	   
	   
 10. Save the web.config file. 
	   
 11. GSAapplication.master is a newly added file for reference purpose. This file is used to reduce the whitespace displayed at the top of the search results. (steps below are applicable only for SharePoint 2007)
     To use this sample master page, copy the file to the Layouts folder (path - C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS).
     Modify the Page Directive MasterPageFile attribute like -  MasterPageFile="~/_layouts/GSAapplication.master" in the GSASearchresults.aspx page found on the same path.
