Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
1) "Verify Installation" dialog box is not a "Modal" dialog box
2) User can not go back and change the installation folder after clicking "Next" on the "Select Installation Folder" panel
3) The message on "Select Installation Folder" panel is misleading as it does not mention that the installer must be installed at SharePoint's 12 Hive's ISAPI directory only.
